        <h1>MOT Testing</h1>
        <p>Our MOT tests cover many aspects of a vehicle. We check the lighting and signalling function of the vehicle. Moreover, we test the steering to see if it meets the required standards. We also test the wheels, tyres, brakes and the safety belt system. All these components have to meet the standards stipulated by the DVSA guidelines. We check the general body and structure of the vehicle. This includes mirror housing, spoilers and bumpers. The driver’s view of the road is also a crucial component that we have to look at. Finally, we test exhaust emissions and function. At NorthWest Bimmers, we carry out professional MOT tests and we don’t leave any component unchecked. We issue genuine MOT pass certificates.
