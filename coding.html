            We offer a service where we can code features into your vehicle (if they are available) at a fraction of the cost of what BMW would charge, plus we can change some things for you like they wouldn't, for example removing the speed limiter.
            
            What can be coded into your vehicle will depend on what equipment and model it is, if you’re interested in any of the below get in touch with us for a free consultation and we’ll let you know what you can have and whether we recommend it.
            
            Please note that not all options listed below are available for all vehicles. Some options may require additional hardware as well. Please contact us for a specific list of services available for your vehicle.</p>
